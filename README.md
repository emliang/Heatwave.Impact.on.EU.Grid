# Heatwave Impact on European Electricity Grids

## Overview
This code repository contains the implementation and analysis for the study of [heatwave](https://climate.copernicus.eu/heatwaves-brief-introduction) effects on European electricity grids. As climate change increases the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves, it is crucial to understand their impact on electricity grids to enhance societal security and resilience.

## Methodology
![Alt text](/images/framework.png)
The methodology employed in this study includes the following key components:

- **Future Heatwave Projection:** It generates projected heatwave events from 2025 to 2050 based on historical heatwaves from 2019 and 2022.
- **Future Demand Modeling:** It utilizes [Demand.ninja](https://demand.ninja/) to model power demand considering the weather condition and annual growth.
- **Renewable Generation:** It leverages existing frameworks from [Atlite](https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite) to calculate renewable generation given weather conditions.
- **Conductor Thermal Modeling:** It analyzes the impact of elevated temperatures on conductor physical properties and their effects on thermal limits.
- **Multi-Segment Modeling:** It models the transmission line at segmented levels to identify localized stress points and potential bottlenecks.
- **Optimal Power Flow Analysis:** It integrates these components to simulate the grid's response under thermal and demand stresses, revealing potential capacity bottlenecks and load shedding regions.
